    "- **Perfect overlap with Item field:** All 609 missing Price Per Unit values occur when Item is also missing (100% co-missingness)\n",
    "- Missing rates vary by category (4.09%-5.56%), with Milk Products showing the highest rate\n",

    "- Not MNAR because the missingness is explained by the Item field status, not by the price values themselves\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key finding:** When `Item` was not recorded during data collection, `Price Per Unit` was also systematically omitted. However, since both `Total Spent` and `Quantity` are present, we can deterministically reconstruct all missing prices with zero estimation error.\n"
